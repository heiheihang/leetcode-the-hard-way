## Overview

Sieve of Eratosthenes is a way of finding all prime numbers up to $$n$$ (inclusive).

First we mark all integers as true except 0 and 1. Then starting from 2, we mark out all multiples of 2 that are bigger than itself because they are composite. The next integer that is not marked out is 3 and it is prime. We mark out all multiples of 3 that are bigger than itself. Similarly, we search for the next integer $$k$$ that is not marked out and is prime, then mark out all multiples of $$k$$.

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
vector<bool> sieveOfEratosthenes(const int n) {
  assert(n >= 2 && "N must be greater or equal to 2");
  vector<bool> isPrime(n + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return isPrime;
}
```
