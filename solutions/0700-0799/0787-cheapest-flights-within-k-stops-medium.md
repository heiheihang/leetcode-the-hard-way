# 0787 - Cheapest Flights Within K Stops (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/

## Problem Statement

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return _**the cheapest price** from_ `src` _to_ `dst` _with at most_ `k` _stops._ If there is no such route, return __ `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-3drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-1drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-2drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `flights[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
* `fromi != toi`
* `1 <= pricei <= 104`
* There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
* `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
* `src != dst`

## Approach 1: Bellman Ford

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    template<typename T_a3, typename T_vector>
    void bellman_ford(T_a3 &g, T_vector &dist, int src, int mx_edges) {
	// dist[i] : dist to reach node j using at most i edges from src
        dist[src] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= mx_edges; i++) {
            T_vector ndist = dist;
            for (auto x : g) {
                auto [from, to, cost] = x;
                ndist[to] = min(ndist[to], dist[from] + cost);
            }
            dist = ndist;
        }
    }
    
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        vector<array<int, 3>> g;
        vector<int> dist(n, 1e9);
        for (auto f : flights) g.push_back({f[0], f[1], f[2]});
        bellman_ford(g, dist, src, k);
        return dist[dst] == 1e9 ? -1 : dist[dst];
    }
};
```
