# 0069 - Sqrt(x) (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach 1: Binary Search

Prerequisite: [Binary Search](../../tutorials/basic-topics/binary-search)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        // init possible range
        long long l = 0, r = x;
        while (l < r) {
            long long m = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
            // exclude m
            if (x < m * m) r = m - 1;
            // include m
            else l = m;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```
