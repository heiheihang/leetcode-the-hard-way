# 0278 - First Bad Version (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/

## Problem Statement

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach 1: Binary Search

```cpp
// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        // init possible range
        int l = 1, r = n;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            // [F,F,..,F,T,T,T,..,T]
            // exclude m
            if (!isBadVersion(m)) l = m + 1;
            // include m
            else r = m;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```
